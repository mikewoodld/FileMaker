In this directory, you will find information on how to use the gobo image library tool. 

<h1>Introduction</h1>
I wanted to create a way to automatically insert a gobo image into a gobo image container without having to search the internet each time for the image or create a storage-space-hungry table in my FileMaker solution. 

I moved all my gobo images over to a public directory and then wrote a FileMaker script that can pull the image into a container. 

<h2>What you need</h2>
- Working internet connection
- FileMaker solution built with at least a Gobos Table
- 2 fields: "Gobo Name" (text) and "Gobo Image" (container

<h2>How it works</h2>
